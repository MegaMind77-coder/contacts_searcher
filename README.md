A simple Implementation of the Regex and Pyperclip module in Python3.6

THIS ALLOWS YOU TO SEARCH FOR CONTACTS AND EMAILS 


ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS COPY A  BLOCK OF TEXT ON YOUR CLIPBOARD 


THEN RUN THE PROGRAM USING PYTHON3.6


THE LOGIC IS BASED ON SIMPLE PATTERN MATCHING


P.S:
you need the pyperclip module of python


clone the repository 
before Running the program

Run the following command on terminal:

    pip3 install pyperclip
  
  
I would suggest using a virtual environment to install pyperclip 
since the module requirements would not interfere with other projects.
